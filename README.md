## 1. Overview

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting loan risks based on financial data. The dataset includes information on loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status (0 for healthy loans, 1 for high-risk loans). The goal is to build models that can effectively identify high-risk loans and assist in making informed lending decisions.

## 3. Project Development Stages

i. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load loan data from `lending_data.csv`.
   - Explore and summarize the dataset to understand the variables.

ii. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

iii. **Model Building:**
   - Implement logistic regression models for loan risk prediction.
   - Evaluate model performance on the original data.

iv. **Resampling Techniques:**
   - Utilize Random OverSampling to address class imbalance.
   - Refit models with resampled training data.

v. **Evaluation and Comparison:**
   - Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and balanced accuracy.
